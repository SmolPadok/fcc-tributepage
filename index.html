                <p><b>1986 - 1994:</b> Attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, majoring in electrical engineering opposed to computer science, as she wanted the more difficult major. Graduated with Bachelor's Degree, Master's and PhD within that time period.</p>
                <p><b>1994 - 1999:</b> Worked as a technical staff at Texas Instruments. Dr. Su played an important role of developing the <i>recipe</i> to make copper connections to work with semiconductors, which result in 20% faster performance than aluminium designs.</i></p>
                <p><b>2000 - 2007:</b> Work at IBM Emerging Products division. Ran a startup company that manufactures biochips and low-power broadband semiconductors.</p>
                <p><b>2007 - 2011:</b> CTO at Freescale Semiconductor.</p>
                <p><b>2012 - 2014:</b> Senior vice president and general manager at Advanced Micro Devices. Played a prominent role in diversifying AMD's portfolio beyong the PC market by integrating AMD chips in Xbox One and PS4 gaming consoles. Became CEO of AMD on 8 October 2014, replacing Rory Read. Dr. Su stated that her plan for the company will focus on making the right technology investments, streamlining the product line and continue to diversify the company.</p>
                <p><b>2015 - 2016:</b> Dr. Su and other AMD executives present a long-term strategy to focus on high performance computing for three growth areas: gaming, datacenter and <i>immersive platforms</i> markets. In January 2016, Su announced that AMD was working on new FinFET-based chips to create a new line of microprocessors, products, accelerated processing units (APUs), graphics chips, and semi-custom chip designs for unreleased video game consoles.</i></p>
                <p><b>2017 - Present:</b> AMD launches Ryzen CPUs built using the Zen architecture. AMD's CPU market share surges to nearly 11%. Ryzen CPUs receives favourable reviews, highlighting their high thread counts at pricces drastically lower than Intel's.</p>
